**Section:** B15 - Powering Progress: Crafting Reliable EV Infrastructure in San Diego  

**Mentor:** Phi Nguyenï¼ŒAri Gaffen, and James McCloskey,TA: Teresa Lee

## Methodology 5 Questions

**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
The most fascinating topic we've explored is the significant disparity in EV charging infrastructure access across different demographic groups in San Diego. Through analyzing various datasets, we discovered that charging station locations strongly correlate with socioeconomic factors, creating "charging deserts" in underserved communities. This pattern mirrors broader California trends where EV adoption and infrastructure are concentrated in affluent, predominantly white and Asian communities.

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
I would like to develop an equity-focused EV charging infrastructure deployment model for San Diego. This investigation would:
- Analyze current charging station distribution relative to demographic data
- Identify underserved communities and charging deserts
- Create a multi-criteria optimization model considering:
  - Socioeconomic factors
  - Population density
  - Current and projected EV adoption rates
  - Grid capacity constraints
  - Economic viability metrics
The goal would be to design a deployment strategy that increases charging access in underserved areas by 40% while maintaining profitable utilization rates above 50%.

**3. What is a potential change you'd make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
In Quarter 1, we focused heavily on technical aspects like charging station locations and grid capacity. For Quarter 2, I would incorporate more social equity metrics into our analysis. This would include:
- Adding demographic data layers to our geographical analysis
- Including income level and housing type (multi-unit vs single-family) in our deployment criteria
- Considering public transportation routes and community mobility patterns
- Analyzing the impact of different charging technologies (Level 2 vs DC Fast) on accessibility

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
To enhance our equity-focused deployment model, I would like to incorporate:
- Geospatial clustering algorithms to identify optimal charging station locations
- Machine learning models to predict EV adoption patterns in different communities
- Network analysis to evaluate charging accessibility across different neighborhoods
- Multi-objective optimization techniques to balance equity goals with economic constraints
- Visualization tools like interactive maps to communicate findings effectively to stakeholders
