**Section:** B15 - Powering Progress: Crafting Reliable EV Infrastructure in San Diego  

**Mentor:** Phi Nguyenï¼ŒAri Gaffen, and James McCloskey,TA: Teresa Lee

## Methodology 5 Questions

**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
The integration of machine learning models with real-world infrastructure data is particularly fascinating Learn how predictive modeling can be used to predict the future needs of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations, highlighting the intersection of data science and sustainable urban planning

In addition, the most interesting topic we explored was the huge differences in access to EV charging infrastructure among different demographic groups in San Diego. By analyzing various data sets, we found that the location of charging stations correlates with socioeconomic factors, namely that EV adoption and infrastructure are concentrated in affluent white and Asian communities.

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
I would like to develop an EV charging infrastructure deployment model for San Diego. 

This investigation would:

- Analyze current charging station distribution relative to demographic data
- Identify underserved communities and charging deserts
- Create a multi-criteria optimization model considering:
  - Socioeconomic factors
  - Population density
  - Current and projected EV adoption rates
  - Grid capacity constraints
The goal would be to design a deployment strategy that increases charging access in underserved areas by 40% while maintaining profitable utilization rates above 50%.

**3. What is a potential change you'd make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
In Quarter 1, we focused heavily on technical aspects like charging station and charging station locations. For Quarter 2, I would incorporate more social equity metrics into our analysis. This would include:
- Adding demographic data layers to our geographical analysis
- Including income level and housing type (multi-unit vs single-family) in our deployment criteria
- Analyzing the impact of different charging technologies (Level 2 vs DC Fast) on accessibility

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
I am interested in exploring geospatial analysis and clustering algorithms to identify areas of high demand for new charging stations. In addition, I would like to utilize neural networks for demand forecasting, as they may provide greater accuracy when working with large cubes.

To be specific,I would like to include:
- Geospatial clustering algorithms to identify optimal charging station locations
- Machine learning models to predict EV adoption patterns in different communities
- Network analysis to evaluate charging accessibility across different neighborhoods
