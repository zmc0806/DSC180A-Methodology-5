**Mentor:** Phi Nguyen，Ari Gaffen, and James McCloskey,TA: Teresa Lee

## Methodology 5 Questions

**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  

The integration of machine learning models with real-world infrastructure data is particularly fascinating Learn how predictive modeling can be used to predict the future needs of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations, highlighting the intersection of data science and sustainable urban planning

In addition, the most interesting topic we explored was the huge differences in access to EV charging infrastructure among different demographic groups in San Diego. By analyzing various data sets, we found that the location of charging stations correlates with socioeconomic factors, namely that EV adoption and infrastructure are concentrated in affluent white and Asian communities.

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  

I would like to develop an EV charging infrastructure deployment model for San Diego. 

This investigation would:

- Analyze current charging station distribution relative to demographic data
- Identify underserved communities and charging deserts
- Create a multi-criteria optimization model considering:
  - Socioeconomic factors
  - Population density
  - Current and projected EV adoption rates
  - Grid capacity constraints
The goal would be to design a deployment strategy that increases charging access in underserved areas by 40% while maintaining profitable utilization rates above 50%.

**3. What is a potential change you'd make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  

In Quarter 1,  the project mainly focused on data collection and visualization to identify existing trends in EV charging station  distribution. However, the analysis was limited by its static nature and reliance on basic visualizations.

For Quarter 2, I propose the following changes: 

- **Dynamic Modeling**: Incorporate machine learning models like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Prophet for time-series forecasting. This will allow us to predict future charging demands based on historical data trends and seasonality.  
- **Integration of External Data Sources**: Use traffic flow data, socio-economic factors, and SDG&E’s Time-of-Use pricing plans to improve the model’s accuracy. These factors will help capture user behavior, such as peak travel times and charging patterns.  
- **Enhanced Visualization**: Build interactive dashboards using tools like Plotly or Dash, providing stakeholders with a clearer understanding of predictive insights and allowing them to test various scenarios interactively.


**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

Beyond time-series analysis, I am interested in experimenting with clustering algorithms for spatial optimization of EV chargers. For example, K-Means could help identify underserved areas based on geographic and demographic data. Additionally, neural networks could be used for more complex predictive modeling involving multiple data streams.
